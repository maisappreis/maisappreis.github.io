                    Innovative and task-driven professional with 2 years of experience in web
                    design and development. I have solid knowledge of JavaScript and
                    Vue.js framework. As a web developer, I have officially been in
                    the job market for a year, but my learning and my first projects started
                    a little over a year ago. I started my career in the administration area,
                    working with finance, then I decided to start a business with 3D printing,
                    and finally, I discovered and fell in love with software development.
